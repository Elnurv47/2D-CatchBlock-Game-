# 2D-CatchBlock-Game-
Currently, I am making 2D mini-projects to learn game programming. These scripts are used to make game called Catch Blocks.
In this game, basically you have a cube which only moves horizontally and there are bunch of blocks which are falling.
Falling Blocks have 4 different types. 3 of them are standart blocks that increase your score by 1. But, fourth block (White Block) give you a bonus for 20 seconds.
When you have that bonus your score are increasing by 5 per blocks.
Also, your main block changes its color. In order to catch block successfully, your main block and falling block's color should be same. Otherwise, you will lose
